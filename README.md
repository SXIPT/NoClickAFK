## 👋 Hi there!

**Bachelor of Science in Energy Engineering, specializing in AI-based automation and robotics.**  
Currently an AI and automation engineer focused on building autonomous systems.

I design and implement intelligent automation solutions using cutting-edge AI technologies and agent-based architectures.  
My goal is to eliminate repetitive tasks and enable systems that think, act, and improve autonomously.  
I work at the intersection of engineering, data, and intelligence — creating scalable infrastructures for business process automation and decision-making systems.
